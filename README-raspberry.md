# Passbolt on the RaspberryPI

In order to build and run the Passbolt Docker images on a RaspberryPI, do the following:

```
$ cd raspberry
$ sudo ./install.sh
$ sudo ./startup.sh
```

If all goes well, you should be able to access Passvolt by visiting `https://raspberrypi-ip-address`
from any computer on the network.

It should run fine on Raspbian, as well as derivative distributions.
