      <para>Here are some things that should be done ... Note that some of these

      <para>If you see something you'd really like to see implemented here, feel
	 free to send me a mail: it may make me move it to the top of my to-do list ;) .
      </para>
      <para>If you plan to help me, please send a mail at &email; to prevent two
	 people from doing the same thing. You can send me some propositions as

	       <para>Use directory notifications (FAM) / inotify, and support a fcrontab
	       and a cron.d as Vixie cron does (directly included in fcron itself, not thanks to a script as now).
               However the parsing work is done by fcrontab, and should probably keep on being done by fcrontab for
               security and stability reasons: have fcron call fcrontab to do that job?</para>

	 <title>Ideas</title>
	 <itemizedlist>
	    <listitem>
	       <para>add a system of modules: at startup, fcron loads some
		  modules (.so files). Then, when fcron should run the job, it
		  calls a function of the module, and let it manage the job
		  (threads?). (do linux dlopen(), etc exist on other systems?
		  - yes: thanks Harring ;) dlopen exists on all POSIX system -
		  even windoze - abait it does not use the same insterface of
		  function calls. But it can be easily implemented to port to
		  another system.).</para>
	    </listitem>
	    <listitem>
	       <para>(related to the system of modules? create a kind of
		  dependencies?)  Add a way to run a job only if a command
		  returns true. It would permit, for instance, to run some jobs
		  on a laptop only if it is on AC power.</para>
	       <para>and depending on the return value of the command, cancel
		  the execution, or wait x seconds before trying again, etc. 
	       In this case, needs change the way the jobs are queued?</para>
	    </listitem>
	    <listitem>
	       <para>add an option/module to prevent fcron from running a job if the
		  system is running on battery (anacron does it?)</para>
	    </listitem>
	    <listitem>
	       <para>Add a way to stop a job (SIGSTOP) if the lavg gets to high,
		  and restart it (SIGCONT) when the lavg has decreased.</para>
	    </listitem>
	    <listitem>
	       <para>Add a timeout for task completion: if a task takes more
		  than a specified timeout, then start another script with the
		  initial task PID as argument.  That would allow a kill with
		  different signals (-HUP, -TERM -STOP, .... or any other action
		  like sending a mail to sysadmin to alert him/her that a task
		  is taking too much time and that he has to have a look at it.)
		  (add an option to specify the cmd, and combine w/ option until)
