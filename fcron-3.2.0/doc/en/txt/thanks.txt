          Has worked on fcron's integration in Linux Debian system,
          reported bugs and corrected some of them, made some
          propositions.

   Thomas Whateley <thomas@whateley.net>
          Has done a big part of Solaris port, implemented the fcron.conf
          file, and Vixie crontab format support.

   Guy Geens <ggeens@iname.com>
          Fixed a nasty bug in goto_non_matching() which caused an endless
          loop (midmonthly jobs executed after the 15th of the month).

   Patrick Ohly <Patrick.Ohly@gmx.de>
          Added fcron's option -y, -o and -l, and fcrontab's stdout and
          volatile, in order to run fcron from time to time in foreground,
          for instance in a ppp-up script.

   Russell Coker <russell@coker.com.au>
          Helped me to secure fcron, make code clearer, and he wrote the
          patch for SE Linux support.

   Alain Portal
          Initial French translation of the manual pages.
