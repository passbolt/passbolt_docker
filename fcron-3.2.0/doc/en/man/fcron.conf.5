.SH NAME
fcron.conf \- configuration file for fcron and fcrontab
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.SS "ABSTRACT"
.PP
This page describes the syntax used for the configuration file
of \fBfcrontab\fR(1), \fBfcrondyn\fR(1) and \fBfcron\fR(8).
.PP
Blank lines, line beginning by a hash sign (#) (which are
considered comments), leading blanks and tabs are ignored. Each line in a
\fBfcron.conf\fR file is of the form
.sp
.RS
.PP
name = value
.RE
where the blanks around equal-sign (=) are ignored and
optional. Trailing blanks are also ignored.
.PP
The following names are recognized (default value in parentheses):
"VALID VARIABLES IN A FCRON.CONF FILE"
.TP
\fBfcrontabs=\fIdirectory\fB  (\fI/usr/local/var/spool/fcron\fB)\fR
\fBFcron\fR spool directory.
.TP
\fBpidfile=\fIfile-path\fB  (\fI/usr/local/var/run/fcron.pid\fB)\fR
Location of \fBfcron\fR pid file (needed by \fBfcrontab\fR
to work properly).
.TP
\fBfifofile=\fIfile-path\fB  (\fI/usr/local/var/run/fcron.fifo\fB)\fR
Location of \fBfcron\fR fifo file (needed by
\fBfcrondyn\fR to communicate with \fBfcron\fR).
.TP
\fBfcronallow=\fIfile-path\fB  (\fI/usr/local/etc/fcron.allow\fB)\fR
Location of fcron.allow file.
.TP
\fBfcrondeny=\fIfile-path\fB  (\fI/usr/local/etc/fcron.deny\fB)\fR
Location of fcron.deny file.
.TP
\fBshell=\fIfile-path\fB  (\fI/bin/sh\fB)\fR
Location of default shell called by \fBfcron\fR when
running a job. When \fBfcron\fR runs a job, \fBfcron\fR uses the value of \fBSHELL\fR from the fcrontab if any, otherwise it uses the value from \fIfcron.conf\fR if any, or in last resort the value from \fI/etc/passwd\fR\&.
.TP
\fBsendmail=\fIfile-path\fB  (\fI/usr/sbin/sendmail\fB)\fR
Location of mailer program called by \fBfcron\fR to
send job output.
.TP
\fBeditor=\fIfile-path\fB  (\fI/usr/bin/vi\fB)\fR
Location of default editor used when invoking
"fcrontab -e".
File-paths and directories are complete and absolute
(i.e. beginning by a "/").
.PP
To run several instances of \fBfcron\fR simultaneously on the same
system, you must use a different configuration file for each instance. Each
instance must have a different fcrontabs,
pidfile and fifofile\&. Then, use \fBfcron\fR(8)'s command line option
\fI-c\fR to select which config file (so which instance) you
refer to.
.SH "FILES"
.TP
\fB\fI/usr/local/etc/fcron.conf\fB\fR
Configuration file for \fBfcron\fR, \fBfcrontab\fR and
\fBfcrondyn\fR: contains paths (spool dir, pid file) and default programs to use
(editor, shell, etc). See \fBfcron.conf\fR(5) for
more details.
.TP
\fB\fI/usr/local/etc/fcron.allow\fB\fR
Users allowed to use \fBfcrontab\fR and \fBfcrondyn\fR (one
name per line, special name "all" acts for everyone)
.TP
\fB\fI/usr/local/etc/fcron.deny\fB\fR
Users who are not allowed to use \fBfcrontab\fR and
\fBfcrondyn\fR (same format as allow file)
.TP
\fB\fI/usr/local/etc/pam.d/fcron\fB (or \fI/usr/local/etc/pam.conf\fB)\fR
PAM configuration file for
\fBfcron\fR\&. Take a look at \fBpam\fR(8) for more details.
.SH "SEE ALSO"

\fBfcrontab\fR(1),

\fBfcrondyn\fR(1),

\fBfcrontab\fR(5),

\fBfcron.conf\fR(5),

\fBfcron\fR(8).

If you're learning how to use fcron from scratch, I suggest
that you read the HTML version of the documentation (if your are not reading it
right now! :) ): the content is the same, but it is easier to navigate thanks
to the hyperlinks.
