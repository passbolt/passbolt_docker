.SH NAME
fcrondyn \- dialog dyn-amically with a running fcron daemon
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBfcrondyn\fR [ \fB-c \fIfile\fB\fR ] [ \fB-i\fR ]


\fBfcrondyn\fR [ \fB-c \fIfile\fB\fR ] \fB-x \fIcommand\fB\fR


\fBfcrondyn\fR [ \fB-h\fR ]

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBFcrondyn\fR is a user tool intended to interact with a running
fcron daemon. It can, for instance, list user's jobs loaded by fcron, run one of
them, renice a running job, send a signal to a running job, etc.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP
\fB-i\fR
Run \fBfcrondyn\fR in interactive mode. \fBfcrondyn\fR is also
run in interactive mode when no option is given.
.TP
\fB-x \fIcommand\fB\fR
Run \fIcommand\fR and returns
immediately. See below for syntax
and a list of commands.
.TP
\fB-c \fIfile\fB\fR
Make \fBfcrondyn\fR use config file
\fIfile\fR instead of default config file
\fI/usr/local/etc/fcron.conf\fR\&. To interact with a running
\fBfcron\fR process, \fBfcrondyn\fR must use the same config file as the process. That
way, several \fBfcron\fR processes can run simultaneously on an only system.
.TP
\fB-d\fR
Run in debug mode. In this mode, many informational
messages will be output in order to check if anything went wrong.
.TP
\fB-h\fR
Display a brief description of the options.
.TP
\fB-V\fR
Display an informational message about \fBfcrondyn\fR,
including its version and the license under which it is distributed.
.SH "COMMAND DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBFcrondyn\fR\&'s command syntax is the following: 
.sp

.TP
\fBjobid\fR
A job id given by one of \fBfcrondyn\fR\&'s
\fBls*\fR commands (i.e. an integer).
.TP
\fBsig\fR
A signal number, or its name (case does not matter).
For instance, "term" or "15".
.TP
\fBniceval\fR
A job priority value. A
\fBniceval\fR is an integer from -20 (highest
priority) to 19 (lowest) (only root is allowed to use a negative value with this
option).
.PP
Last, but not least, the following commands are recognized
(optional arguments are between []):
"VALID FCRONDYN'S COMMANDS"

\fBhelp\fR
.TP
\fBh\fR

commands.
.TP
\fBquit\fR
.TP
\fBq\fR
In interactive mode, quit fcrondyn.
.TP
\fBls [user]\fR
List all jobs of user. When \fBls\fR is
run by root, all users are listed unless a user name is given as argument. See below for some explanations about the
fields used by \fBls*\fR commands.
.TP
\fBls_lavgq [user]\fR
Same as \fBls\fR, but list only the jobs
which are in the load-average queue (i.e. which are waiting for a lower load
average to be run).
.TP
\fBls_serialq [user]\fR
Same as \fBls\fR, but list only the jobs
which are in the serial queue (i.e. which are waiting for
other jobs to be finished).
.TP
\fBls_exeq [user]\fR
Same as \fBls\fR, but list only the jobs
which are running.
.TP
\fBdetail jobid\fR
Print details about a
job. \fBjobid\fR is the one given by
\fBls\fR\&.
.TP
\fBrunnow jobid\fR
Instead of waiting for the next scheduled execution
time, run the job now. The next execution time is changed as
if the job had run on schedule.
.TP
\fBrun jobid\fR
Run the job now. Its next execution time is not changed.
.TP
\fBkill sig jobid\fR
Send a signal to a running job.
.TP
\fBrenice niceval jobid\fR
Change the priority of a running job.
"FIELDS USED BY DETAIL AND     LS* COMMANDS"
.TP
\fBID\fR
Job's unique identification number.
.TP
\fBUSER\fR
User who owns this job.
.TP
\fBPID\fR
The pid of the running job.
.TP
\fBINDEX\fR
Index of the job in the serial queue (i.e. it will be run when all the jobs of an inferior index have been run)
.TP
\fBR&Q\fR
The job has this number instances of the given task which are either running or queued in the serial or lavg queue.
.TP
\fBOPTIONS\fR
List of main options which are set for the task.
L for the jobs which run only under a given system Load average (option lavg, lavg1, lavg5 and lavg15), LO (Load average Once) if only at most one instance of the task can be in the load average queue at a given time (option lavgonce), S for serialized jobs (option serial), SO for the jobs which will be serialized only for the next execution (Serial Once), and ES if several instances of the same job can run simultaneously (option exesev).
.TP
\fBLAVG\fR
3 values, corresponding to the 1, 5, and 15-minute (in
this order) system load average values below which the job
will be run, otherwise it will be queued until the system
load average is appropriate (see lavg option).
.TP
\fBUNTIL\fR
Field corresponding to the until option.
.TP
\fBSTRICT\fR
Field corresponding to the strict option. Y for
yes, N for no.
.TP

If you're learning how to use fcron from scratch, I suggest
that you read the HTML version of the documentation (if your are not reading it
right now! :) ): the content is the same, but it is easier to navigate thanks
to the hyperlinks.
