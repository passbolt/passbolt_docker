1.2. How to install fcron

     * uncompress the archive:

       bash$ tar -xzf fcron-X.Y.Z.src.tar.gz

     * cd to the archive directory

       bash$ cd fcron-X.Y.Z

     * run the configure script:

       bash$./configure

          + The command make install asks you by default some questions
            you have to answer. To avoid that (which can be useful for
            automatic installers), you can use the ./configure's option
            --with-answer-all and/or --with-boot-install (see "./configure
            --help" for more details).
          + You may also want to change the place where fcron will be
            installed: you can use the configure 's option --prefix to do
            that. For instance: ./configure --prefix=/usr/local (default
            is prefix=/usr)
          + To disable the use of PAM, SE Linux or fcrondyn, use
            configure's option --with-pam=no, --with-selinux=no and/or
            --with-fcrondyn=no.
          + To debug fcron, you should use configure 's option
            --with-debug.
          + You can get info on the others configure 's options by running
            "./configure --help".

                                    Warning
         + The configure script may not define a correct directory for
           the man pages and the documentation on some systems. You may
           check the values defined by configure and if necessary force a
           value by the options --mandir and -with-docdir (see the help
           by running "./configure --help").
         + If you get older fcron's man-pages with man command after
           having upgraded, it's probably because fcron has changed its
           default man directory: you should remove manually the outdated
           man-pages.
         + The Makefile has been designed for GNU make. Some other
           version of make may fail to use it.

     * (optional) check the file config.h, and change it if necessary (the
       configurable part is on the top of the file and clearly delimited).
     * compile:

       bash$ make

     * then install binaries as root:

       bash$ su root

       bash# make install

   You can now run fcron and fcrontab.

     * This is a POSIX conforming software. You must have a POSIX compiler
       (gcc for example) in order to compile it.
     * This software has been written for GNU/Linux systems. If you want
       to port it on an other Unix platform (thank you if you do it), try
       to modify - if possible - only the configure script. Please send me
       any modifications at <fcron@free.fr> in order to include it in
       future releases.
