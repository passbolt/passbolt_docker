CLASS="ANSWER"
><P
><B
> </B
>       First, you must understand that fcron determines, for each job, its next
time and date of execution. It then determines which of those jobs would be the
next to run and then, sleeps until that job should be run. In other words, fcron
doesn't wake up like Vixie cron each minute to check all job in case one should
be run ... and it avoids some problems associated with clock adjusts.</P
><P
>       This means that if the new time value is set into the past, fcron won't
run a particular job again. For instance, suppose the real time and system clock
are 3:00, so the next job cannot be scheduled to run before 3:00, as it would
have already been run and re-scheduled.</P
><P
>       First, suppose you set your system clock into the past, say to 2:00,
Presuming that the last run was shortly before 3:00. then fcron will sleep until
the next job should be executed. The execution time for a job is determined by
identifying the last time that the job ran and computing the next scheduled
time. This means that the next scheduled time must be on or after 3:01.
Therefore, in this example, fcron will not run a job for at least one
hour.</P
><P
>       Next, if you set the system time into the future, say to 4:00, fcron will
run every job scheduled between the old and the new time value once, regardless
of how many times it would have been scheduled. When fcron wakes up to run a job
after the time value has changed, it runs all the jobs which should have run
during the interval because they are scheduled to run in a past time.</P
><P
>       As special case is when "@xxx" style scheduling rules are involved, you
must consider the "adjustment-interval". The "adjustment-interval" is the time
difference between the original system time and the new system time. The concerned
jobs will run at "adjust-interval" too
early or too late depending of the nature of the adjust.</P
><P
>       To conclude, fcron behaves quite well for small clock adjusts. Each job
which should have run does so once, but not exactly at the correct time as if
the job were scheduled within the adjustment interval. But, if you have to make
a big change in the time and date, you should probably reset all the scheduled
"nextexe" by running "fcrontab -z" on all the fcrontabs.</P

><H3
>2.2.2. How does fcron handle daylight saving time changes?</H3
></P
></DIV
><DIV
CLASS="ANSWER"
><P
><B
> </B
>There are two types of daylight saving time change: 
the remove-one-hour change (for instance, "at 3:00, it will be 2:00"), 
and the add-one-hour one (for instance, "at 2:00, it will be 3:00").
In both cases, fcron will run the job only once (more precisely, it won't
run the job twice as many as it should have).</P
><P
>In the first case, the official time changes as follow
(in order of real chronological time): [x, 2:00] -&#62; i1: [2:00, 3:00]
 -&#62; i2: [2:00, 3:00] -&#62; [3:00, y]. i1 and i2 are the names of the two
intervals [2:00, 3:00]. For this kind of DST change, a job which should
run between 2:00 and 3:00 will run either in i1 or in i2, but not both.
Consequently, a job scheduled to run every day at 2:30 (for instance)
will be run only once. There is no way for a user to know if the job will
be run in i1 or i2.</P
><P
>In the second case, there is a gap in time:
the official time changes as follow (in order of real chronological time):
[x, 2:00] -&#62; [3:00, y]. A job scheduled between 2:00 and 3:00 will get
run once, and only once, even if it should have been run several times.
For instance, a job which should have run every 10 minutes will run only
once, not 6 times, between 1:59 and 3:01. A job scheduled to run at
2:xx will run at 3:xx. For instance, if a job is scheduled to run
every day at 2:30, it will run at 3:30 the day of this kind of DST change.</P

CLASS="ANSWER"
><P
><B
> </B
>We suppose here that you are using swsusp and the hibernate
		  script to do a "suspend to disk", but it should be similar
		  with other methods.</P
><P
>When you switch on your computer after a suspend to disk,
		  the system time will be incorrect, and will then be corrected
		  by the hibernate script. Before it is corrected, fcron may
		  compute the time and date of the next execution of a job:
		  the computation would then be incorrect (please see the entry
		  about system clock adjustment in the present FAQ).</P
><P
>So you should have the hibernate script stop fcron before
		  the suspend, and then restart it when the system is switched on,
		  ie. put a line like "RestartServices fcron" in your hibernate.conf
		  file. That way, the system time will always be correct when
		  fcron runs (assuming that fcron is started after the system time
		  is corrected).</P

>      The "/proc/loadavg" file provides loadavg values. These values are (in
order): the system load averages for the past 1, 5, and 15 minutes; a count of

		</P
><P
>      The active task count includes those processes marked as running or
uninterruptable. A load average is an estimate of the average number of
processes running within a specified period. The load averages are computed from
active task count. They are updated each time active task counts are taken.

><B
> </B
>As far as I know, fcron supports completely the syntax of
		  Vixie cron's crontab, excepted the @* syntax (@annually,
		  @weekly, etc: if you use that, you will have to replace it
		  with the explicit equivalent given in crontab(5)). So you
		  should not have much problem with that (otherwise, please
		  contact me at <CODE
CLASS="EMAIL"
>&#60;<A
HREF="mailto:fcron@free.fr"
>fcron@free.fr</A
>&#62;</CODE
>).</P
><P
>The main problem is about the management of the system (f)crontab.
		  Vixie cron monitors the changes on /etc/crontab every minute,
		  and automatically takes into account the changes if any.
		  As for now, fcron do not do that. Fcron do not support the
		  /etc/cron.d/ dir too, as it is just an extension of the /etc/crontab
		  file.
		  But be reassured: /etc/cron.{daily,weekly,monthly} are supported
		  by fcron (in fact, those dirs are not managed by fcron directly,
		  but by run-parts, which is independent from fcron).</P
><P
>So if you want to replace transparently Vixie cron by fcron,
		  all you have to do is creating a /usr/bin/crontab link to
		  /usr/bin/crontab, and to reinstall the system (f)crontab
	       with fcrontab /etc/crontab each time you modify it
		  (if you find something else to do, please tell me!).</P
><P
>You can also use the script script/check_system_crontabs
		  to generate a system fcrontab from /etc/(f)crontab and /etc/cron.d/,
		  and install it automatically. If you choose to do that, take 
		  a look at the beginning of the script: you will find insctructions
		  on how to use it -- and a few warnings you should pay attention to.
		  With this script, the behavior of fcron should be very similar
		  to Vixie cron's one concerning /etc/crontab and /etc/cron.d/.
