Type: note
Description: Warning: interactions with anacron!
 If you have the anacron package in the 'removed' but not 'purged'
 state (i.e. anacron configuration files are still around the system),
 the fcron package will cause harmless side effects, such as reports
 of anacron being started at boot up.
 .
 DO NOT FILE BUGS AGAINST ANACRON IF YOU HAVE FCRON INSTALLED IN THE
 SYSTEM. They will be either reassigned to fcron to be summarily closed
 by me, or summarily closed by the anacron maintainer himself.
 .
 More information about this issue is available in
